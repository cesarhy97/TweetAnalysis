# TweetAnalysis Project
Using Twitter API and data for a Data Mining project for my semester abroad in Mannheim University, Germany.

More detailed information:
-the first option is to use classification algorithms in rapid miner to detect if a tweet is a bot or not, for this we are using the following training data https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~szuhg2/data.html from the Univesity of Oxford.
-the second option is to apply text mining techniques to do sentiment analysis of tweets regarding certain topics.
-a thirds option could be to do cluster analysis of tweets maybe by location (still don't know)
